# Development Flow

- Always run:
  - `dotnet build`
  - `dotnet test`
  - `dotnet format`

- Do not merge or commit changes unless all of the above pass.
- Add missing tests before introducing new logic.
- Fix all tests when refactoring interfaces - tests are part of the change, not separate.

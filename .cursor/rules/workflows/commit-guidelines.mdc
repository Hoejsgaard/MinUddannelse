# Git Commit Guidelines

- DO NOT commit, push, or stage files without explicit user confirmation.
- Use semantic prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`

## Write Like Rune

Tell the story: why was this needed, what does it accomplish.
Be direct and professional. Avoid fluff.

## Workflow

Always use temporary file for proper formatting:

```bash
cat > temp_commit_msg.txt << 'EOF'
feat: add retry logic for bank API failures

The Danske Bank API fails during peak hours, blocking reconciliation.
Added exponential backoff with 3 retries to handle 503/504 errors.
This should reduce failed imports by 80%.
EOF

git commit -F temp_commit_msg.txt
rm temp_commit_msg.txt
```

## Common Scopes

`banking`, `auth`, `api`, `secrets`, `infra`, `tests`

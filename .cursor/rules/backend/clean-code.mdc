# Clean Code Guidelines

- Favor clarity over brevity.
- Use expressive names: `minUddannelseClient` > `client`
- Avoid side effects: functions should do one thing
- Use consistent formatting (auto-format code)
- Comment only when the "why" isn't obvious — never for the "what"
- Avoid magic strings/numbers — extract constants

## Style Rules

- No XML documentation or verbose comments
- Only document side effects and complex business logic
- Use descriptive namespaces (Authentication vs DataRetrieval)
- Move/rename classes when purpose changes

## Examples

Bad:
```csharp
if (x == 4) { DoThing(); }
```

Good:
```csharp
if (retryCount == MaxRetries) { NotifyUser(); }
```

# Development & Reasoning Procedure

Follow this mental loop when working with the codebase:

1. **Understand** the context and task. Don’t act until the problem is clear.
2. **Investigate**: read existing code, review structure, locate relevant modules.
3. **Plan**: break changes into steps, define expected outcomes.
4. **Execute carefully**: respect commit/secret/dev rules.
5. **Verify**: run all tests, format the code, confirm no secrets leaked.
6. **Reflect**: was this the minimal, cleanest fix? Did I improve things?

Never default to fast output — quality matters more than speed.

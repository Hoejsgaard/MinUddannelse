TLDR

WIP - integrate automatically with aula so I can push important information to email/slack/calender instead of actually using Aula. 

Notes
First findings; this is rough. Tried to get a token, but found nowhere to get it from, so now I'm imitating the web login flow, which is a super volatile approach.

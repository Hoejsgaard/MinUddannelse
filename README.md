# MinUddannelse Family Assistant

> **Finally, push notifications for school communications!** üéìüì±

An intelligent family automation system that integrates with the Danish school platform **MinUddannelse** to provide automated school communication and interactive AI assistance for busy parents.

## The Problem This Solves

**Every Danish parent knows the frustration**: You need to manually log into MinUddannelse (Aula) constantly just to check what's happening at your children's school this week. Is there homework due tomorrow? A field trip on Thursday? Parent meeting next week?

**This project eliminates that friction** by:
- ‚úÖ Automatically fetching weekly school communications
- ‚úÖ Pushing updates directly to your family's Slack and Telegram channels
- ‚úÖ Providing an AI assistant that knows your children's schedules
- ‚úÖ Setting up intelligent reminders for important events
- ‚úÖ Syncing school events to your family calendar

**The result?** School information flows to you seamlessly, without the daily login ritual that makes managing multiple children's schedules a chore.

## What This Project Does

### Core Functionality
- **üîê Authenticates with MinUddannelse** using secure UniLogin SAML flow (per child)
- **üìÑ Fetches weekly letters** from your children's school classes automatically
- **üì¢ Posts updates** to configured Slack and Telegram channels
- **ü§ñ Interactive AI chat** - Ask questions about school activities in natural language (Danish/English)
- **‚è∞ Smart reminders** - Create and manage AI-powered reminders based on school content
- **üìÖ Calendar integration** - Sync school events to Google Calendar automatically

### Evolution: From Manual Checking to Proactive Intelligence

**Before (Manual Hell):**
- Log into MinUddannelse multiple times per week per child
- Manually check for homework, events, and updates
- Risk missing important deadlines or events
- No central family view of school activities

**Current (Intelligent Assistant):**
- Automatic weekly letter fetching and distribution
- AI-powered natural language interaction via Slack/Telegram
- Context-aware conversations about each child's activities
- Proactive reminder creation with smart scheduling
- Cross-platform family coordination

**Future (Autonomous Agent):**
- Automatic analysis of weekly letters for action items
- Proactive reminder setup: *"Hey, remember to pack light tomorrow - Emma's class has a field trip to the zoo!"*
- Smart homework tracking and parent notifications
- Family calendar coordination with conflict detection

## Recent Quality Improvements (October 2025)

**‚úÖ Sprint 2: Code Quality & Security Hardening**
- **Architectural consolidation**: Unified 3 duplicate SAML authentication implementations
- **Code reduction**: Eliminated 174 lines of duplicate code (-16%)
- **Complexity reduction**: 70% decrease in authentication flow complexity
- **Memory management**: Proper disposal patterns and resource cleanup
- **Test coverage**: All 1,533 tests passing with 68.66% line coverage
- **Security hardening**: Input validation, rate limiting, and audit trails

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Enhancements:**
- Child-centric agent pattern for multi-child isolation
- Template Method pattern for extensible authentication
- Repository pattern with proper dependency injection
- Channel abstraction for easy integration expansion

## Security & Production Readiness

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Secrets Management**
**BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**: Migrate secrets from `appsettings.json` to secure storage:

```bash
# For local development - use dotnet user-secrets
cd src/MinUddannelse
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "MinUddannelse:Children:0:UniLogin:Password" "your-password"
dotnet user-secrets set "OpenAi:ApiKey" "sk-proj-your-key"
```

### üîí **Security Features**
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Each child's data is strictly isolated
- **Input sanitization**: 24 blocked patterns protect against prompt injection
- **Rate limiting**: Per-child, per-operation limits prevent abuse
- **Audit logging**: Full trail of authentication and data access
- **SAML authentication**: Secure integration with Danish UniLogin system

### üìä **Production Quality Metrics**
- **68.66% test coverage** with 1,533 automated tests
- **Zero critical vulnerabilities** (after secret migration)
- **Proper error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Resource management** with automatic cleanup
- **Logging & monitoring** with structured audit trails

## Critical Hosting Requirement

**‚ö†Ô∏è MinUddannelse blocks major cloud providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) by IP range.

**‚úÖ Supported hosting:**
- **Home server/NAS** on residential internet
- **VPS providers** not on major cloud infrastructure
- **Dedicated servers** with business/residential IP ranges

**‚ùå Blocked hosting:**
- AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Cloud Compute
- Most major cloud platforms
- Corporate datacenter IP ranges

This is a **hard technical requirement** - the authentication will fail on blocked IPs.

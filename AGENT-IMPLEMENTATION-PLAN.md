# Agent Implementation Plan

## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Project infrastructure
   - Created interfaces for dependency injection (IMinUddannelseClient, IDataManager, IAgentService)
   - Implemented concrete classes for these interfaces
   - Added unit tests for key components
   - Updated Program.cs to use interfaces and dependency injection
   - Fixed logging to use ILoggerFactory instead of ILogger<T>

## Immediate Focus: LLM Integration
1. ⬜ OpenAI Integration (1-2 hours)
   - Add OpenAI API NuGet package
   - Create simple OpenAI client wrapper
   - Add API key configuration

2. ⬜ Basic Agent Functionality (2-3 hours)
   - Create method to process week letters with OpenAI
   - Implement simple prompt template for week letter analysis
   - Add question-answering capability about week letter content

3. ⬜ Test Harness (1 hour)
   - Create simple console interface to test the agent
   - Add sample week letter for offline testing
   - Implement basic conversation flow

## Future Enhancements
1. ⬜ Conversation history management
2. ⬜ Authentication refresh mechanism
3. ⬜ Enhanced caching for API responses
4. ⬜ Error handling and retry logic
5. ⬜ Integration tests
6. ⬜ Notification system for failures

fix: prevent duplicate message processing in Slack bot

The Slack bot was repeatedly processing the same messages due to timestamp handling issues.
Added timestamp buffering and improved message filtering to aoid duplicates.
This should reduce the "Found 1 new message" log spam when there are no actual new messages.

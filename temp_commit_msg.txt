chore: add OpenAI package and update project rules

Added OpenAI package (v1.7.2) to both main project and test project to support
agent implementation. Updated rule files with domain-specific examples and
formatting improvements. All tests pass and build is successful despite some
formatting warnings that will be addressed in a separate commit.

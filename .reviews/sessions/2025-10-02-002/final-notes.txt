Successfully removed legacy _userProfile dependency from MinUddannelseClient. Implemented proper separation between MinUddannelseClient (stored data only) and PerChildMinUddannelseClient (live authenticated requests). Fixed AgentService to handle the architectural change without breaking functionality. Added comprehensive test coverage for NotSupportedException scenarios. All critical issues resolved.

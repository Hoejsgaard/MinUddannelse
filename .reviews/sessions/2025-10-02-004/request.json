  "summary": "Fixed build errors by correcting namespace imports and updating test constructor calls after architectural cleanup. The main issues were:\n\n1. Missing Child type imports - Child class is in Aula.Configuration namespace, not Aula.Core.Models\n2. Missing StoredWeekLetter import in PerChildMinUddannelseClient\n3. Test constructor calls using old signatures after Config parameter removal from PictogramAuthenticatedClient and PerChildMinUddannelseClient constructors\n4. Removed obsolete MinUddannelseClientTests.cs test file for deleted MinUddannelseClient class\n\nAll changes maintain the architectural separation established in previous work where authentication clients are standalone with hardcoded URLs, and PerChildMinUddannelseClient serves as pure orchestration facade.",

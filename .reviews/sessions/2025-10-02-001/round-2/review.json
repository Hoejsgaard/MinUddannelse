        "description": "The GetChildId method now returns child.FirstName as a fallback when _userProfile is not loaded. This is architecturally incorrect because FirstName is NOT a valid child ID for the API. The API expects a numeric/unique identifier, not a name.",
        "impact": "critical",
        "recommendation": "Either implement proper per-request authentication to obtain the real child ID, or throw a clear exception indicating that this client requires authentication before use. Using FirstName as ID will cause API calls to fail with invalid parameters."

      "comment": "Returning child.FirstName as the child ID is fundamentally wrong. The MinUddannelse API expects a proper child ID (likely a GUID or numeric identifier), not a first name. This will cause GetWeekLetter and GetWeekSchedule to fail with API errors.",

      "comment": "The check for _userProfile.HasValues is good, but the fallback strategy is incorrect. This creates a false sense of graceful degradation when it actually breaks the API contract.",
      "suggested_fix": "Either: 1) Implement lazy authentication that calls LoginAsync when needed, 2) Require authentication in the constructor, or 3) Make this an abstract method that derived classes must implement."

      "comment": "The attempt to provide graceful degradation actually makes the system fail in unpredictable ways. Using an invalid child ID will result in HTTP 400 or 404 errors from the API, which is harder to debug than a clear exception at the point of failure.",

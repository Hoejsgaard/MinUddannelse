      "severity": "major",
      "category": "architecture",
      "comment": "The constructor is passing empty strings for username and password to the base class, which violates the constructor contract of UniLoginAuthenticatorBase that expects non-null values. This appears to be a workaround for per-request authentication but creates a fragile design.",
      "suggested_fix": "Consider refactoring UniLoginAuthenticatorBase to support optional credentials or create a separate base class for per-request authentication scenarios."

      "category": "bug",
      "comment": "The GetChildId method references _userProfile which is never initialized in the new constructor path that uses IWeekLetterRepository. This will always throw InvalidOperationException when called.",
      "suggested_fix": "Either initialize _userProfile properly in both constructor paths, or refactor to pass child identification through a different mechanism that doesn't rely on pre-loaded user profile data."

      "severity": "minor",
      "category": "missing_feature",
      "comment": "LoginAsync method is still present in the base class but the interface no longer declares it. This creates an inconsistency where the implementation has methods not in the contract.",
      "suggested_fix": "Mark the LoginAsync method in UniLoginAuthenticatorBase as protected or remove it entirely if authentication is meant to be per-request."

      "category": "architecture",
      "comment": "The comment mentions 'Authentication now happens per-request in MinUddannelseClient' but MinUddannelseClient doesn't appear to implement per-request authentication properly given the _userProfile issue.",
      "suggested_fix": "Ensure the per-request authentication is fully implemented before removing the authentication checks from AgentService."

      "comment": "The Obsolete attribute provides good migration guidance but the interface is still actively used throughout the codebase.",

      "category": "architecture",
      "comment": "MinUddannelseClient is registered as Scoped but it seems to maintain state (_userProfile) that might be problematic in a scoped lifetime.",
      "suggested_fix": "Consider whether MinUddannelseClient should be Singleton if it maintains authentication state, or ensure it's truly stateless for Scoped registration."
    },

      "type": "general",
      "severity": "major",
      "category": "architecture",
      "comment": "The removal of LoginAsync from interfaces while keeping it in implementations creates an architectural inconsistency. The per-request authentication model is not fully realized since MinUddannelseClient still depends on pre-loaded user profile data.",
      "suggested_fix": "Complete the authentication refactoring by either: 1) Implementing true per-request authentication that doesn't depend on _userProfile, or 2) Keeping the LoginAsync contract in the interface until the refactoring is complete."

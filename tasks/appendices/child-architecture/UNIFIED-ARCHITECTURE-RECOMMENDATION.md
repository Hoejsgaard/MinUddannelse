# Unified Architecture Recommendation: Child-Centric Aula

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive analysis by architecture, implementation, and security specialists, we recommend transforming Aula from its current **service-centric architecture** to a **child-centric domain model** where children become first-class citizens with isolated service contexts and intelligent channel routing.

## Current State Problems

### Architecture Issues
- ❌ **Children are DTOs**: Simple data objects passed between services
- ❌ **Identity Crisis**: Children identified by mutable strings (FirstName)
- ❌ **Context Loss**: Child context doesn't flow through operations
- ❌ **Channel Blindness**: Channels have no concept of children
- ❌ **Service Proliferation**: Child logic scattered across multiple services

### Real Impact on Your Use Case
> "I want to share my channels with other parents in TestChild1' class, then TestChild2's data has no business in that channel"

**Currently Impossible Because:**
- Single global channel configuration
- No per-child channel routing
- No data isolation between children
- No parent access control

## Proposed Architecture: Three Pillars

### 1. Domain-Driven Child Model

```csharp
// Transform from anemic DTO to rich domain entity
public sealed class Child : IAggregate
{
    // Stable Identity
    public ChildId Id { get; }

    // Encapsulated State
    public ChildProfile Profile { get; private set; }
    public ChildAuthentication Authentication { get; private set; }
    public ChildChannelConfig Channels { get; private set; }

    // Domain Behaviors
    public bool ShouldReceiveNotificationOn(Platform platform, NotificationType type);
    public void AuthorizeParentAccess(ParentId parent, AccessLevel level);
    public ChannelRoute GetChannelRouteFor(NotificationType type);
}
```

### 2. Child Service Containers

```csharp
// Each child gets isolated service instances
public class ChildServiceContainer
{
    public IChildAuthenticationService Authentication { get; }
    public IChildDataService DataService { get; }
    public IChildCacheService Cache { get; }
    public IChildChannelManager Channels { get; }

    // Isolated failure handling
    public async Task<bool> IsHealthy();
    public async Task Reinitialize();
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Channel Routing

```csharp
// Per-child channel management with parent access control
public class ChildChannelOrchestrator
{
    public async Task SendToChildAsync(ChildId childId, Notification notification)
    {
        var child = await GetChildAsync(childId);
        var routes = child.GetChannelRoutesFor(notification.Type);

        foreach (var route in routes)
        {
            // Only send to authorized channels for this child
            await route.Channel.SendAsync(notification.Format(child));
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal**: Establish child identity without breaking existing code

```csharp
// Backward compatible child identity
public partial class Child
{
    private ChildId? _id;
    public ChildId Id => _id ??= ChildId.From(FirstName, LastName);
}
```

**Changes:**
- Add ChildId value object
- Update cache keys to use ChildId
- Add child registry service
- Feature flag: `UseChildIdentity`

### Phase 2: Service Isolation (Weeks 4-6)
**Goal**: Create per-child service containers

```csharp
// New startup pattern
services.AddChildScopedServices(children =>
{
    foreach (var child in children)
    {
        services.AddChildContainer(child.Id)
            .WithAuthentication()
            .WithCaching()
            .WithDataService();
    }
});
```

**Changes:**
- Implement ChildServiceOrchestrator
- Create per-child service factories
- Update AgentService to use containers
- Feature flag: `UseChildContainers`

### Phase 3: Channel Revolution (Weeks 7-9)
**Goal**: Enable per-child channel configuration

```csharp
// New channel configuration
"Children": [
  {
    "Id": "testchild1-martin-2025",
    "FirstName": TestChild1,
    "Channels": {
      "Slack": {
        "ChannelId": "C123456",  // TestChild1's class channel
        "AuthorizedParents": ["parent1", "parent2"]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "Id": "soren-johannes-2025",
    "FirstName": "TestChild2",
    "Channels": {
      "Slack": {
        "ChannelId": "C789012",  // TestChild2's class channel
        "AuthorizedParents": ["parent1"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

**Changes:**
- Implement ChildChannelOrchestrator
- Add parent authorization system
- Create channel routing logic
- Feature flag: `UseChildChannels`

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 10)
**Goal**: Complete migration and optimize

- Remove old code paths
- Performance optimization
- Documentation update
- Monitoring setup

## Architecture Benefits

### Immediate Wins
✅ **Data Isolation**: TestChild1's data never appears in TestChild2's channels
✅ **Parent Collaboration**: Share channels with other class parents
✅ **Stable Identity**: No more cache key collisions
✅ **Clear Ownership**: Each child owns their data and settings

### Long-term Benefits
✅ **Scalability**: Add children without system complexity increase
✅ **Maintainability**: Child logic in one place
✅ **Testability**: Test child scenarios in isolation
✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add child-specific features

## Code Examples: Before and After

### Before: Service-Centric
```csharp
// Program.cs - Manual iteration
foreach (var child in config.MinUddannelse.Children)
{
    var letter = await agentService.GetWeekLetterAsync(child, date);
    await channelManager.BroadcastMessageAsync(FormatLetter(letter, child));
}

// AgentService.cs - Child as parameter
public async Task<JObject?> GetWeekLetterAsync(Child child, DateOnly date)
{
    // Child passed through every layer
    return await _dataService.GetWeekLetter(child, weekNumber, year);
}
```

### After: Child-Centric
```csharp
// Program.cs - Orchestrated
await childOrchestrator.ProcessWeeklyLettersAsync(date);

// ChildOrchestrator.cs - Child as context
public async Task ProcessWeeklyLettersAsync(DateOnly date)
{
    await Parallel.ForEachAsync(_children, async (child, ct) =>
    {
        var container = GetContainer(child.Id);
        var letter = await container.Agent.GetWeekLetterAsync(date);
        await container.Channels.SendAsync(letter);
    });
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Migration**: Automated validation of all child data
- **Performance**: Child-specific caching improves performance
- **Compatibility**: Feature flags allow gradual rollout

### Business Risks
- **Parent Confusion**: Clear documentation and UI updates
- **Channel Setup**: Migration wizard for channel configuration
- **Access Control**: Default to current behavior, opt-in to restrictions

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- ✅ 0% data leakage between children
- ✅ 30% reduction in cache misses
- ✅ 50% faster child-specific operations
- ✅ 100% backward compatibility during migration

### Qualitative
- ✅ "TestChild1's parents see only TestChild1's data"
- ✅ "Adding a new child is trivial"
- ✅ "Child preferences are respected"
- ✅ "System tells a clear story"

## Decision Framework

### Option 1: Minimal Change (Not Recommended)
- Add ChildId only
- Keep current service architecture
- **Pro**: Fast implementation (1 week)
- **Con**: Doesn't solve channel isolation problem

### Option 2: Partial Refactor (Viable)
- Add ChildId and per-child caching
- Keep global channel management
- **Pro**: Some benefits (3 weeks)
- **Con**: Channels still broadcast to all

### Option 3: Full Child-Centric (Recommended)
- Complete domain model transformation
- Per-child services and channels
- **Pro**: Solves all identified problems (10 weeks)
- **Con**: Larger investment

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this proposal with stakeholders
2. **Decide** on implementation option
3. **Create** detailed technical design if proceeding
4. **Begin** Phase 1 implementation
5. **Validate** with small user group

## Conclusion

The transformation to a child-centric architecture is not just about cleaner code—it's about enabling the features you need: **isolated child data, parent collaboration, and scalable growth**. The system will finally "read like a great story" where children are the protagonists, not passive data objects.

**The story becomes:**
> "Each child has their own world of services, authentication, and channels. Parents can collaborate within a child's world without affecting other children. The system grows by adding more child worlds, not by making the existing world more complex."

This is the architecture Aula deserves.

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- **src/Aula/**: Main console application - fetches data from Aula (Danish school platform) and posts to Slack/Telegram
- **src/Aula.Tests/**: Unit tests using xUnit and Moq (270 tests, 26% code coverage)
- **src/Aula.Api/**: Azure Functions API project (separate deployment)

### Core Components
- **Program.cs**: Entry point that configures DI, starts interactive bots, and optionally posts weekly letters on startup
- **AgentService**: Core service that handles Aula login and data retrieval via MinUddannelseClient
- **SlackInteractiveBot/TelegramInteractiveBot**: Interactive bots that answer questions about children's school activities using OpenAI
- **OpenAiService**: LLM integration for responding to user queries about school data (switched to gpt-3.5-turbo for cost optimization)
- **DataManager**: Manages children's data and weekly letters with 1-hour memory cache
- **ConversationContextManager**: Handles conversation context for interactive bots
- **SchedulingService**: Database-driven task scheduling with cron expressions

### Key Integrations
- **Aula Platform**: Danish school communication system accessed via UniLogin authentication
- **Slack**: Webhook posting + interactive bot with Socket Mode (5-second polling)
- **Telegram**: Bot API for posting + interactive conversations  
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5-turbo for answering questions about school activities (cost-optimized)
- **Google Calendar**: Schedule integration via service account
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database for reminders, posted letters, scheduling, and app state

### Configuration
Configuration is handled through `appsettings.json` with sections for:
- UniLogin credentials
- Slack (webhook URL, bot token, channel settings)
- Telegram (bot token, channel ID)
- Google Calendar (service account, calendar IDs per child)
- OpenAI API settings (gpt-3.5-turbo, 2000 max tokens)
- Supabase database connection
- Features (preloading, parallel processing, caching)
- Timers (polling intervals, cleanup schedules)

## Code Style Rules (from RULES.md)

### Logging
- Use ILoggerFactory injection instead of ILogger<T> in constructors
- Use LogInformation or higher (avoid LogDebug)
- Let middleware handle exceptions instead of try/catch->log patterns

### Code Style
- Favor clarity over brevity
- Use expressive names (e.g., minUddannelseClient instead of client)
- Avoid side effects - functions should do one thing
- Comment only when the "why" isn't obvious - never for the "what"
- No XML documentation or verbose comments

### Git Commits
- Use semantic prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Common scopes: `unilogin`, `minuddannelse`, `aula`, `auth`, `api`, `secrets`, `infra`, `tests`
- Do NOT add "ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code" or similar attribution comments

## Target Framework
- .NET 9.0
- EnableNETAnalyzers and TreatWarningsAsErrors are enabled
- Tests use xUnit with Moq for mocking

- Improve integration test coverage for core services
- Target 80%+ code coverage with focus on critical paths

**Action Items**:
- Refactor interactive bots to improve testability (reduce constructor dependencies)
- Remove duplicate ConversationContext classes, use shared ConversationContextManager
- Extract message handling logic into separate, testable classes
- Add comprehensive mocking for HTTP clients and external services

#### 2. Week Letter Automation Enhancement (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current State**: Weekly fetching Sundays at 4 PM, basic scheduling, retry logic
**Goals**:
- Implement smart default scheduling (Sunday 4 PM local time if none configured)
- Add CRUD operations for schedule management via LLM
- Enhance timing configuration and timezone handling

**Action Items**:
- Add startup schedule initialization if none exists
- Implement LLM-powered schedule modification commands
- Add timezone-aware scheduling configuration
- Improve retry logic with exponential backoff

#### 3. Crown Jewel Feature: Intelligent Automatic Reminders (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Vision**: Extract actionable items from week letters and create automatic reminders

## Development Philosophy

### Testing Strategy
- **Refactor first, test afterwards** - Never compromise code quality by forcing tests onto problematic code
- **Focus on shared utilities** - Extract common patterns before duplicating test code
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - Aim for edge cases, error handling, and proper mocking
- **Integration testing** - Test critical paths end-to-end

### Architecture Principles
- **Shared abstractions** - Use interfaces and dependency injection consistently
- **Configuration-driven** - Make behavior configurable rather than hardcoded
- **Fail gracefully** - Handle external service failures without crashing
- **Cost-conscious** - Optimize expensive operations (OpenAI calls, database queries)

### AI Integration Best Practices
- **Cost optimization** - Use appropriate model for task complexity
- **Token management** - Implement conversation trimming and caching
- **Multi-language** - Support both English and Danish interactions
- **Structured prompts** - Use templated, efficient prompt construction
- **Context preservation** - Maintain conversation history intelligently

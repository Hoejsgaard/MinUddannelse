## Commands

### Build and Test
```bash
# Build the solution
dotnet build src/Aula.sln

# Run tests (582 tests, 53% line coverage, 43% branch coverage)
dotnet test src/Aula.Tests

# Format code
dotnet format src/Aula.sln

# Run the main application
cd src/Aula && dotnet run

# Run specific test
dotnet test src/Aula.Tests --filter "TestMethodName"
```

### Development Workflow
Always run these commands after code changes (per RULES.md):
1. `dotnet build src/Aula.sln`
2. `dotnet test src/Aula.Tests`  
3. `dotnet format src/Aula.sln`

Do not commit changes unless all commands pass.

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- **src/Aula/**: Main console application - fetches data from Aula (Danish school platform) and posts to Slack/Telegram
- **src/Aula.Tests/**: Unit tests using xUnit and Moq (582 tests, 53% line coverage)
- **src/Aula.Api/**: Azure Functions API project (separate deployment)

### Core Components
- **Program.cs**: Entry point that configures DI, starts interactive bots, and optionally posts weekly letters on startup
- **AgentService**: Core service that handles Aula login and data retrieval via MinUddannelseClient
- **SlackInteractiveBot/TelegramInteractiveBot**: Interactive bots that answer questions about children's school activities using OpenAI
- **OpenAiService**: LLM integration for responding to user queries about school data (switched to gpt-3.5-turbo for cost optimization)
- **DataManager**: Manages children's data and weekly letters with 1-hour memory cache
- **ConversationContextManager**: Handles conversation context for interactive bots
- **SchedulingService**: Database-driven task scheduling with cron expressions

### Key Integrations
- **Aula Platform**: Danish school communication system accessed via UniLogin authentication
- **Slack**: Webhook posting + interactive bot with Socket Mode (5-second polling)
- **Telegram**: Bot API for posting + interactive conversations  
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5-turbo for answering questions about school activities (cost-optimized)
- **Google Calendar**: Schedule integration via service account
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database for reminders, posted letters, scheduling, and app state

### Configuration
Settings are handled through `appsettings.json` with sections for:
- UniLogin credentials
- Slack (webhook URL, bot token, channel settings)
- Telegram (bot token, channel ID)
- Google Calendar (service account, calendar IDs per child)
- OpenAI API settings (gpt-3.5-turbo, 2000 max tokens)
- Supabase database connection
- Features (preloading, parallel processing, caching)
- Timers (polling intervals, cleanup schedules)

## Code Style Rules (from RULES.md)

### Logging
- Use ILoggerFactory injection instead of ILogger<T> in constructors
- Use LogInformation or higher (avoid LogDebug)
- Let middleware handle exceptions instead of try/catch->log patterns

### Code Style
- Favor clarity over brevity
- Use expressive names (e.g., minUddannelseClient instead of client)
- Avoid side effects - functions should do one thing
- Comment only when the "why" isn't obvious - never for the "what"
- No XML documentation or verbose comments

### Git Commits
- Use semantic prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Common scopes: `unilogin`, `minuddannelse`, `aula`, `auth`, `api`, `secrets`, `infra`, `tests`
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT add "ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code" or ANY Anthropic/Claude attribution comments in commits, pull requests, or code

## Target Framework
- .NET 9.0
- EnableNETAnalyzers and TreatWarningsAsErrors are enabled
- Tests use xUnit with Moq for mocking

## Development Philosophy

### Testing Strategy
- **Refactor first, test afterward** - Never compromise code quality by forcing tests onto problematic code
- **Focus on shared utilities** - Extract common patterns before duplicating test code
- **Comprehensive test coverage** - Aim for edge cases, error handling, and proper mocking
- **Integration testing** - Test critical paths end-to-end

### Architecture Principles
- **Shared abstractions** - Use interfaces and dependency injection consistently
- **Configuration-driven** - Make behavior configurable rather than hardcoded
- **Fail gracefully** - Handle external service failures without crashing
- **Cost-conscious** - Optimize expensive operations (OpenAI calls, database queries)

### AI Integration Best Practices
- **Cost optimization** - Use appropriate model for task complexity
- **Token management** - Implement conversation trimming and caching
- **Multi-language** - Support both English and Danish interactions
- **Structured prompts** - Use templated, efficient prompt construction
- **Context preservation** - Maintain conversation history intelligently

## Current Feature Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- Week letter fetching and posting to channels
- Interactive Q&A about school activities
- Manual reminder commands (add/list/delete)
- Conversation context management
- Multi-child support with name-based lookups
- Content deduplication and caching
- Database-driven scheduling
- Cost-optimized OpenAI integration

### üöß In Progress

### üéØ Vision: The Perfect School Assistant
The end goal is an AI-powered family assistant that:
- Automatically extracts and schedules reminders from school communications
- Provides intelligent, contextual responses about children's activities
- Seamlessly integrates with family calendars and communication channels
- Learns from family patterns to provide increasingly helpful automation
- Reduces mental load on parents while ensuring nothing important is missed

This system should feel like having a highly organized, never-forgetting family assistant that understands the complexities of school life and family logistics.

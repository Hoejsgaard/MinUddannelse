3. `dotnet format src/Aula.sln`

Do not commit changes unless all commands pass.

## Architecture

### Project Structure
- **src/Aula/**: Main console application - fetches data from Aula (Danish school platform) and posts to Slack/Telegram
- **src/Aula.Tests/**: Unit tests using xUnit and Moq (811 tests after cleanup)
- **src/Aula.Api/**: Azure Functions API project (separate deployment)

### Core Components
- **Program.cs**: Entry point that configures DI, starts interactive bots, and optionally posts weekly letters on startup
- **AgentService**: Core service that handles Aula login and data retrieval via MinUddannelseClient
- **SlackInteractiveBot/TelegramInteractiveBot**: Interactive bots that answer questions about children's school activities using OpenAI
- **OpenAiService**: LLM integration for responding to user queries about school data (switched to gpt-3.5-turbo for cost optimization)
- **DataManager**: Manages children's data and weekly letters with 1-hour memory cache
- **ConversationContextManager**: Handles conversation context for interactive bots
- **SchedulingService**: Database-driven task scheduling with cron expressions

### Key Integrations
- **Aula Platform**: Danish school communication system accessed via UniLogin authentication
- **Slack**: Webhook posting + interactive bot with Socket Mode (5-second polling)
- **Telegram**: Bot API for posting + interactive conversations  
- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5-turbo for answering questions about school activities (cost-optimized)
- **Google Calendar**: Schedule integration via service account
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database for reminders, posted letters, scheduling, and app state

### Configuration
Settings are handled through `appsettings.json` with sections for:
- UniLogin credentials
- Slack (webhook URL, bot token, channel settings)
- Telegram (bot token, channel ID)
- Google Calendar (service account, calendar IDs per child)
- OpenAI API settings (gpt-3.5-turbo, 2000 max tokens)
- Supabase database connection
- Features (preloading, parallel processing, caching)
- Timers (polling intervals, cleanup schedules)

## Code Style Rules (from RULES.md)

### Logging
- Use ILoggerFactory injection instead of ILogger<T> in constructors
- Use LogInformation or higher (avoid LogDebug)
- Let middleware handle exceptions instead of try/catch->log patterns

### Code Style
- Favor clarity over brevity
- Use expressive names (e.g., minUddannelseClient instead of client)
- Avoid side effects - functions should do one thing
- Comment only when the "why" isn't obvious - never for the "what"
- No XML documentation or verbose comments

### Testing Rules
- **UNIT TESTS ONLY**: Only write unit tests that use mocking and dependency injection
- **NO INTEGRATION TESTS**: Integration tests are explicitly out of scope and should not be created
- **NO REFLECTION**: Never use reflection (GetMethod, GetField, Invoke, BindingFlags) in tests - it creates brittle tests that break with refactoring
- **PUBLIC API ONLY**: Test only public methods and properties - private/internal members should not be tested directly
- **DEPENDENCY INJECTION**: Use constructor injection and mocking to isolate units under test
- **CLEAR INTENT**: Test names should clearly describe what behavior is being verified

### Git Commits
- Use semantic prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Common scopes: `unilogin`, `minuddannelse`, `aula`, `auth`, `api`, `secrets`, `infra`, `tests`
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT add "ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code" or ANY Anthropic/Claude attribution comments in commits, pull requests, or code

## Target Framework
- .NET 9.0
- EnableNETAnalyzers and TreatWarningsAsErrors are enabled
- Tests use xUnit with Moq for mocking

## Critical Test Issues (2025-07-03)

### ‚ùå REFLECTION ABUSE IN TESTS (TECHNICAL DEBT)
**Problem**: 144+ reflection calls across 5 test files making tests brittle and hard to maintain.

**Affected Files**:
- **OpenAiServiceTests.cs**: 79+ reflection calls testing private methods
- **SchedulingServiceTests.cs**: 28+ reflection calls testing private methods  
- **AiToolsManagerTests.cs**: 27+ reflection calls testing private methods
- **TelegramInteractiveBotTests.cs**: 9+ reflection calls testing private fields
- **MessageSenderTests.cs**: 1+ reflection call

**Examples of Violations**:
```csharp
// ‚ùå BAD: Testing private methods via reflection
var method = typeof(OpenAiService).GetMethod("HandleDeleteReminderQuery", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
var result = await (Task<string>)method!.Invoke(service, new object[] { "delete reminder 3" })!;

// ‚ùå BAD: Accessing private fields via reflection  
var configField = typeof(TelegramInteractiveBot).GetField("_config", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);
```

**Solution Strategy**:
1. **Refactor classes to make behavior testable through public APIs**
2. **Extract interfaces for dependencies** - Enable proper mocking
3. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on what the class does
4. **Delete tests that add no value** - Some private method tests may be unnecessary

**Priority**: Address this technical debt before adding new features to prevent further reflection sprawl.

### ‚úÖ INTEGRATION TESTS REMOVED
**Problem**: Misnamed "integration" tests that were actually unit tests with mocks.
**Solution**: Deleted entire `src/Aula.Tests/Integration/` folder (4 files, 2000+ lines).

## Mock Data Feature (2025-07-03)

### ‚úÖ SUMMER TESTING SOLUTION: Mock MinUddannelse Data
**Problem**: No fresh week letters available during summer holidays, making development/testing difficult.

**Solution**: Configuration-driven mock mode that simulates historical week letters as "current" data.

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "Features": {
    "UseMockData": true,           // Enable mock mode
    "MockCurrentWeek": 19,         // Simulate week 19 as "current"
    "MockCurrentYear": 2025        // Simulate year 2025 as "current"
  }
}
```

**How it works**:
1. When `UseMockData: true`, MinUddannelseClient skips API calls
2. Instead returns stored week letters from database for configured week/year
3. App thinks it's getting "live" data but it's actually historical
4. Enables year-round development without requiring fresh MinUddannelse data

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **No code changes needed** - Just flip config flags
- ‚úÖ **Uses existing storage** - Leverages week letter storage system
- ‚úÖ **Natural behavior** - App operates normally, doesn't know it's using mock data
- ‚úÖ **Easy testing** - Switch between real and mock data instantly

**Usage**: Set `UseMockData: true` and configure desired week/year. App will simulate that week as current.
